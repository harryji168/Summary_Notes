We are looking for a senior developer to join our team. Our application is built primarily with Elixir & Phoenix.

This position is ideal for you if you would like to write production applications that will handle a large number of users using the functional programming language Elixir and its up-and-coming Phoenix framework.

The ideal candidate will have 3+ years of experience with the following:

    Backend Web development
    Working with databases (ideally Postgres) and writing SQL queries
    Writing code with MVC and convention over configuration designs patterns
    Writing basic front-end Javascript code
    Writing code for front-end pages with HTML and CSS
    Conducting in-depth code-reviews, giving and receiving constructive feedback

Nice to have experience with:

    Writing production applications using functional programming languages
    Writing HTML and CSS code using the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
    Building applications with Elixir and Phoenix is a huge plus, the second best would be Ruby on Rails.
    Domain-Driven Design methodologies.
