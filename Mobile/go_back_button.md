Google Pixel 6: How To Go Back In Apps & Websites


Still having trouble with the back gesture even after adjusting these settings? Another option is to get rid of the gestures and go back to Android's old button navigation system. This gets rid of gestures and puts buttons on the bottom of the screen. Enabling it is as follows: Open the Settings app, scroll down, tap 'System,' tap 'Gestures,' tap 'System navigation,' and tap '3-button navigation.' The square button opens the multitasking menu, the circle button goes to the Pixel 6's home screen, and the triangle button goes back â€” just with a single tap.

There's no right or wrong answer for which method you should choose. Play around with both options and see which feels the best. If the gestures work well, stick with those. If the buttons feel better, choose those instead. One of Android's best qualities is being able to tweak the UI to your exact liking, right down to changing how to go back.
