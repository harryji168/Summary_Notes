# Hammer.js



Hammer.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that lets you add multi-touch gestures to your Web Apps.

I would recommend this library to add some fun to your components. Here is an example to play with. Just run the pen and tap or click on the grey div.


It can recognize gestures made by touch, mouse and pointerEvents. For jQuery users I would recommend using the jQuery plugin.
