JS: Basics

# [000] Introduction to Javascript

## Why do we learn Javascript?

- The *only* language that runs in the browser

## History and Facts about JS

- written in 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995
- originally it was written for the netscape browser which was bought by mozilla.
- originally called livescript but it was renamed to Javascript to cash in on Java's popularity
- it's the most popular language by most metrics... because it's the only language that runs in the browser... which means as web developers we need to know it.
- It also runs everywhere else with [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# [100] Documentation is king

As web developers most of our time is spent reading, more specifically, reading documentation. Good documentation is gold and the one of the best resources for javascript is [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (Mozilla Developer Network)

## Other useful javascript documentation

- Official NodeJS documentation found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- Good primer on Javascript found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)
- Javascript API [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# [200] Checking your node version

We work with the latest Javascript releasess which means the `node` installed on our machine should be at least v11.0.0
You can check your node version by running `node -v` in terminal
If you need to update your node version run do it via nvm with the command `nvm install node`

## Notes on NVM

NVM stands for Node Version Manager it's just a piece of software that helps us organize/install/switch between all the different releases of NodeJS. Additional documentation can be found on their [github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

# [300] Interactive Javascript

If we want to interactively execute JavaScript code we can use the `node` command
![running node](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/enteringNode.png)

This will create a environment that allows us to execute Javascript Code. We call environments like this REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)

## Demo: Making Javascript do math
Try inputting arithmetic equations
```js
1 + 1
> 2
```
![mathInRepl](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/mathInRepl.png)

## Interactive JS Cont.

While inside of the REPL we can type `.help` to get a list of available commands
![helpCommand](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/helpCommand.png)

## Exiting NodeJS REPL

To exit the NodeJS REPL type in the command `.exit`

# [400] Scripts

A script is a file filled with code taht we can execute

## Creating a script via `touch`

Javascript files have the ".js" extension. Let's create a Javascript file with the `touch` command
```sh
touch helloWorld.js
```

## Creating a script via `code` (Visual Studio Code Command)

Visual studio code provides a CLI command we can download which allows us to open a file or directory in VS. If the file or directory does not exist the command will open it in a [buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(application)) which you can save later.

```
code helloWorld.js
```

### Installing Visual Studio's `code` command

1) Open Visual Studio Code
2) Press `cmd+p`. It's going to bring up a search bar
3) Type in "> code"
4) Select the command "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
5) Try it out!

![vsCode](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/vsCode.png)

## Scripts cont.

Inside of "helloWorld.js" Lets add the following code:
```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

- `console.log` is a function used to print stuff out in the console (the console is our terminal). It accepts a string as an argument.

- all javascript statements end in a optional semi-colon


## Running NodeJS Scripts

we can execute scripts by providing a PATH to them as a argument for the `node` command

```sh
node ./helloWorld.js
```

## Loading a script in NodeJS REPL

We can also load a javascript file from inside of REPL using the `.load` command

```sh
node
.load ./helloWorld.js
```

# [500] Comments

- Comments are text in code which are ignored.
- They are used to leave notes, document code, ect.
- Use them sparingly. Most of the time, if you're writing clean code, your code will speak for itself.

Javascript comments are defined using two forward slashes `//`

Multi-line comments are wrapped in `/*` and `*/`

```js
// Two slashes begin a single line comment

/* I
am
a
multi-line
comment
console.log('wont print')
*/
```

# [600] Definitions

## Program

- Step-by-step instructions to tell a computer to do something
- made up of a bunch of scripts

## Value

- fundamental entity that a program manipulates. Create, Edit, Delete
- A value can be categorized. This is it's "type"

### TypeOf

We can get the type of a value by using the `typeof` operator.

![typeofDemo](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/typeofDemo.png)

## Expression

Code that can be evaluated further into a value is an expression.

![expressionDemo](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/expressionDemo.png)

# [700] Numbers

"number" is a type in javascript that represents numbers.

numbers are created by writing numbers.

```js
678
```

Numbers in Javascript are [double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 745](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers) which means they can occupy a max space of 64 bits, and it's max precision is about 16 decimal digits

## Demo: Let's write some numbers
![numbers](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/numbers.png)

- `_3.14159_` is a float: numbers with decimal places
- `_Infinity_` is a type of number: represents infinity
- `_NaN_` stands for "Not a Number": represents a value that is not a valid number. Example, if you try to subtract a string from a number `2 - "hello"`

## Arithmetic Operators

### Addition
`1 + 1`

### Subtraction
`2 - 1`

### Multiplication
`2 * 2`

### Division
`2 / 2`

### Modulo

Modulo gives you the remainder of a division
`15 % 2`

### Exponentiation
`2 ** 4`

### Unary negation
`-3`

You can find documentation on numbers [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)

# [800] Strings

The String Type represents text

## Creating Strings

You can create strings by:

- double quotes:
```js
"hello world"
```

- single quotes:
```js
'hello world'
```

- back ticks:
```js
`hello world`
```

## Exercise: Escaping Characters

Try the following code:

![escapingChars](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/escapingChars.png)

```js
'Does 'this' work?'
```
This throws an error because javascript interprets the extra quote (`'`) as a closing quote.

```js
"What 'is' this?"
```

This works because only double quotes can close a double quote.

We can also display quotes by escaping them
```js
'What about \'this\'?'
```

## String Concatenation

We can add strings together using the addition operator

```js
"hello" + "world" // helloworld
```

This is called **string concatenation**

### Exercise: Automatic type conversion

Try the following

```js
55 + "world"
```

So, Javascript is loosely typed meaning in certain javascript expressions Javascript will automatically convert the types of some values.

## String Interpolation

Strings created using backtics can have expressions embedded in them.

```js
`${1 + 1 + 1} rings...`
`${3 * 3} for ${"Mortal"} Men...`
```

Expressions can only be embedded within `${}`

This is called **string interpolation**

## String.length

You can get a String's length by appending `.length` after a string

```js
"Dark Lord".length
```

### Exercise: Trying to .length stuff

Try the following in REPL:

![lengthProperty](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/lengthProperty.png)

`20.length` This didn't work because `.length` is only available to Strings
`(20)

## Accessing index of strings

We can use square bracket notation to access specific characters within a string. The selector we use is called an index.

Indexes are positions and they always start from 0. So to get the first index (first character) of a string we go `"dark throne"[0]`

### Exercise: Getting 50 index of "dark throne"
```
"dark throne"[50]
```

It returns `undefined`!

# [800] Undefined

Undefined is a base type that represents something that does not exist. It's usually given when code tries to access something that does not exist.

A lot of times you will experience errors that say "cannot get .something of undefined". When this happens know that the thing you're trying to ".something" on is `undefined`. Check spelling or scope.

# [900] Converting Strings to Numbers

Sometimes you may need to convert a string to a number. Use the `parseInt()` function to accomplish that.

```js
parseInt("10")
```

If you try to `parseInt()` a float it will ignore the decimal points, instead use `parseFloat()`
```js
parseFloat("3.14")
```

If you try to `parseInt()` a string that can't be converted to a number you'll recieve `NaN`
```js
parseInt("aa33")
```

Funny enough this works:
```js
parseInt("33aa")
```
`parseInt` will see that the first character is a number and will keep converting the following characters until it can't.

# [1000] Booleans

The "Boolean" type represents values that are true and false. They're mostly used for logical operations

## Comparison Operators

Some expressions evaluate into a boolean value

### strict equality
```js
1 === 1 //true
1 === '1' //false
```

### strict inequality
```js
1 !== 1 //false
"Bob" !== "Rob" //true
```

### Greater Than
```js
20 > 4 // true
```

### Less Than
```js
20 < 4 // false
```

### Less Than Or Equal To
```js
20 < 20 // false
20 <= 20 // true
```

### Greater Than Or Equal To
```js
20 > 20 // false
20 >= 20 // true
```

### Or Operator
If either side of the operator is true then the entire statement is true
```js
false || true // true
0 > 10 || 10 > 0 // true
0 > 10 || 1 > 10 // false
```

### And Operator
If either side of the operator is false then the entire statement is false
```js
true && false // false
0 > 10 && 10 > 0 // false
0 > 10 && 1 > 10 // false
11 > 10 && 12 > 10 // true
```

# [1100] Variables

- A Variable is a name that points to a value
- Using a variable evaluates to the value it points
- Making a varaible is a declaration
- Giving a variable a value is an assignment
- You don't need to assign a varaible a value

## Creating Variables

There are 3 keywords used to declare a variable `var`, `let`, `const`
Modern Javascript does not use `var` anymore.

### Declaring variables with let
```js
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined;
a = 1;
console.log(a); // 1;
```

Lets crete a variable `b` which is assigned to `a`

```js
let b = a;
console.log(b); // 1
```

**Now `b` is pointing to the same thing `a` is pointing to**.

### Declaring variables with const
Try doing the same thing with `const`

![const](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/const.png)

Variables created with const can never be assigned to another value. You must also always assign it a value at declaration

A general clean code good practice is to use `const` whenever possible and `let` for every other case. Don't use `var`

# [1200] Passing Arguments to Scripts
Inside of a JavaScript file that is being run using NodeJS a `process` variable is provided to us. We can access this `process` variable anywhere in any file as long as it's being run by NodeJS.

Open up a NodeJS REPL and type in `process` to see what `process` is.

![printingProcessPt1](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/printingProcessPt1.png)

It's a really big "object" (we learn objects later) that contains information about what the current process (instance of a program).

The `process` variable has a property called `argv`. This `argv` property is a list (array, we learn this later) that has a bunch of strings, all of which are arguments to the script.

## Demo: scriptWithArgs.js
Create a script that prints out `process.argv`
```js
console.log(process.argv);
```

We can pass arguments when running a script by adding them after the file PATH
```sh
node ./scriptWithArgs.js elephant bamboo
```

When we execute this script we'll get something like this:
![priintingProcessArgv](https://github.com/CodeCoreYVR/bootcamp_materials/blob/master/js-basics/photos/priintingProcessArgv.png)

The `process.argv` variable is a indexed value. Just like strings we can select a position within the value by an index. When running a script, the 0 index is where the NodeJS binary lives, the 1 index is the PATH of the script being executed, every index after that are arguments we provide. So, to get the first argument we can do `process.argv[2]`, get the second argument with `process.argv[3]`, and so on.

# [1300] Control Flow

Control flow determines which parts of code within a program get executed.

We have basic program statements to create control flow...

## Conditionals

### if statement

The `if` statement is used to do something if a condition is true.

_example if statement_
```js
if (true) {
  console.log('burn them all');
} else {
  console.log('feed them cake');
}

// will print 'burn them all'
```

The `if` statement consists of several parts
1) the `if` keyword
2) followed by parenthesis that contain an expression `(true)`
3) followed by a "block" of code in the curly braces `{}`

- A block of code is just a group of code that belongs together. Many programming statements make use of blocks

If the expression inside of the parenthesis `()` will turn into a boolean value. If it is true the block immediately following the expression will be executed.

4) an `else` clause also has a block of code, but it only gets executed if all the above statement's expressions evaluate to false

```js
if (false) {
  console.log('burn them all');
} else {
  console.log('feed them cake');
}

// will print 'feed them cake'
```

You can add an `else if` clause to an `if` statement which gives more condition options

```js
if (10 > 100) {
  console.log('10 is greater than 100');
} else if (150 > 100) {
  console.log('150 is greater than 100');
} else if (200 > 100) {
  console.log('200 is greater than 100');
} else {
  console.log('default statement reached')
}
// prints out '150 is greater than 100'
```

**Once a conditional is met the corresponding block gets executed. All subsequent statements are ignored**

### ternary operator
A ternary operator is used for conditionals. It's like a short form of the `if else` statement
```js
true ? console.log('burn them all') : console.log('feed them cake');

// prints 'burn them all'
```
If the expression to the left of `?` is `true` the code immediately after `?` and before `:` is executed, otherwise the code after the `:` is executed.
```js
false ? console.log('burn them all') : console.log('feed them cake');

// prints 'feed them cake'
```

**ternary operators are not statements they are expressions**
**ternary operators only have a expression for true and false, there are no if else expressions.** However you can nest another ternary inside a ternary but this is really unreadable and highly frowned upon.

# [1400] Iterations

Iteration is doing something multiple times. This is usually done using loops, which are another javascript statement

## while loop

A while loop will execute a block of code as long as an expression is true
```js
while(true) {
  console.log('winter is coming');
}
```
A while loop consists of:
1) `while` keyword
2) expression within parenthesis `(true)` that turns into a boolean
3) a block of code `{console.log('winter is coming')}`

Hopefully you didn't run the above snippet of code! It will keep printing 'winter is coming' because the expression inside the parenthesis is always true! We call this an infinite loop, it's to be avoided at all costs.

### Demo: Logging 100 to 0;

```js
let i = 100;
while(i > 0) {
  console.log(i);
  i--; // decrement i;
}
```
On every iteration of this loop we are decrementing `i` by one so we get closer to the break case where `i = 0` so `i > 0` eventually is false.

## for loop

Another kind of loop is a `for` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

The for `loop` iterates just like the `while` loop but it provides some extra things that we'd probably add to `while` loops:

1) for loops are defined using the `for` keyword
2) the have parenthesis that contain 3 arguments
  a) we can declare a variable on declaration of the loop `let i = 0` (and also assign it a variable). **we must have a semi colon after!**
  b) then we need to add the expression `i < 5`. **we must have a semi colon after!**
  c) then we can increment some variables `i++`. **we must have a semi colon after!**
3) a block of code

# [] Scopes
A Scope is where variables are accessible. Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped. Meaning the accessibility of these variables are limited to the block they are in.
You can access variables outside of a block but not into a block
