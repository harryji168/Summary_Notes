# Introduction to Gitpod

Gitpod is a container-based development platform that puts developer experience first. Gitpod provisions ready-to-code developer environments in the cloud accessible through your browser and your local IDE.

Gitpod enables development teams to describe their dev environment as code and start configurable and fresh developer environments for each new task entirely in the cloud. Think CI/CD for dev environments.
