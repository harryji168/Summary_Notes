Having the project on such status, will surely stop all active services and resources, this includes the charges as well.

Google Cloud Support, Mark9:28 AM
I see that you are requesting to cancel the charges, and as a valued customer, here is what I can do best.
Google Cloud Support, Mark9:29 AM
I know how very important the resolution to your concern is. It's also important to me, that is why I'm treating this with urgency. And the best way for me to help you resolve your concern is to Allow me to submit a One-time courtesy adjustment, on your behalf, to our Specialized team. This request will be subjected for review and approval by them. This may take 24 to 48 hours for feedback to be provided.
Google Cloud Support, Mark9:29 AM
Though before this request is submitted, we shall need to ensure that all final charges are shown and to be included on the request. For this, we need to wait for 24 to 32 hours for the system to propagate the pending charges and apply to your billing account. This is to ensure that all unwanted charges for the project is included on our request (if there would still be any unapplied charges prior to having the project stopped completely).

* This is 32 hours after the services (Shutdown project) has been stopped completely
