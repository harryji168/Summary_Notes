cPanel is a web hosting control panel software developed by cPanel, LLC. It provides a graphical interface (GUI) and automation tools designed to simplify the process of hosting a web site to the website owner or the "end user". It enables administration through a standard web browser using a three-tier structure. While cPanel is limited to managing a single hosting account, cPanel & WHM allows the administration of the entire server.

In addition to the GUI, cPanel also has command line and API-based access that allows third-party software vendors, web hosting organizations, and developers to automate standard system administration processes.[3] cPanel & WHM is designed to function either as a dedicated server or virtual private server. The latest cPanel & WHM version supports installation on CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and CloudLinux OS.[4] cPanel 11.30 is the last major version to support FreeBSD.


cPanel is currently developed by cPanel, L.L.C., a privately owned corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, United States.[7] It was originally designed in 1996 as the control panel for Speed Hosting, a now-defunct web hosting company.
