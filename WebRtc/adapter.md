WebRTC adapter
adapter.js is a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences in WebRTC. The prefix differences are mostly gone these days but differences in behaviour between browsers remain.

This repository used to be part of the WebRTC organisation on github but moved. We aim to keep the old repository updated with new releases
