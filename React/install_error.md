There might be a problem with the project dependency tree. It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

"babel-eslint": "9.0.0"

Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically. However, a different version of babel-eslint was detected higher up in the tree:

javascript
reactjs
react-native
react-redux
react-router

create .env file in your project file and add the following statement

SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
Save the file

Remove node_modules, yarn.lock, package.lock

Then reinstall node_modules with

npm install
This should work

###### Attempted import error: 'Switch' is not exported from 'react-router-dom'

In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import from

import { Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
to

import { Routes ,Route } from 'react-router-dom';
