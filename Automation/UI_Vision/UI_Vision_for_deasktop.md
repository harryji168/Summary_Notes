# Desktop Automation with UI.Vision RPA

https://ui.vision/rpa/x/desktop-automation

How to create desktop automation macros:
 In the UI.Vision RPA settings go to the VISION tab and select "Desktop Automation" as operating mode. This switches the UI.Vision RPA eyes from the web browser to the desktop. It also switches the "Select" and "Find" buttons operate on the desktop and not inside the browser.

 Visual macros are best constructed like a Lego car: Add XClick after XClick command to the macro, and build the macro step by step. Example: How to click and drag in RPA

 Use the "Select" button to take a screenshot of the area that you want the RPA to click or to watch. Use "Find" button to verify if the image is found as expected.

 Note that the "Record" button is only for Selenium IDE type browser automation macros. Recording is not available for the XClick, XMove and XType commands.
