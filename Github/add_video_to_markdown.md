# How to embed a video into GitHub README.md?

Add a url to video file in your ReadMe.
Github now supports videos, see more detailed answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4279746/1092815

You can see a live example here (See at the end of the readme):

Github Pages
I strongly recommend placing the video in a project website created with GitHub Pages instead of the readme, like described in VonC's answer; it will be a lot better than any of these ideas. But if you need a quick fix just like I needed, here are some suggestions.

Use a gif
See aloisdg's answer, result is awesome, gifs are rendered on github's readme ;)

Use a video player picture
You could trick the user into thinking the video is on the readme page with a picture. It sounds like an ad trick, it's not perfect, but it works and it's funny ;).

Example:

[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://youtu.be/vt5fpE0bzSY)
Result:

Watch the video

Use youtube's preview picture
You can also use the picture generated by youtube for your video.

For youtube urls in the form of:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<VIDEO ID>
https://youtu.be/<VIDEO URL>
The preview urls are in the form of:

https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO ID>/maxresdefault.jpg
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO ID>/hqdefault.jpg
Example:

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/T-D1KVIuvjA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T-D1KVIuvjA)
