At GitHub, we’ve always felt that you should be able to open a pull request to start a conversation with your collaborators as soon as your brilliant idea or code is ready to take shape. Even if you end up closing the pull request for something else, or refactoring the code entirely, a good pull request is as much about collaboration as it is about code.

But what if you want to signal that a pull request is just the start of the conversation and your code isn’t in any state to be judged? Perhaps the code is for a hackathon project. You have no intention of ever merging it, but you’d still like people to check it out locally and give you feedback. Or perhaps you’ve opened a pull request without any code at all in order to get the discussion started.
