Run in your terminal:

$ mix phx.new books_api --no-html  --binary-id && cd books_api
 
## 
We are almost there! The following steps are missing:

    $ cd books_api

Then configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create

Start your Phoenix app with:

    $ mix phx.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

    $ iex -S mix phx.server


$ mix phx.new books_api --no-html --no-webpack --binary-id && cd books_api

$ mix ecto.migrate

$ mix phx.gen.json Store Book books \
title:string isbn:text:unique description:text price:float authors:array:string --no-context --no-schema

Installing Phoenix
Now that we have Elixir and Erlang ready, let’s install the Phoenix application bootstrapping script with:

$ mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.3
Creating the Phoenix project
Run in your terminal:

$ mix phx.new books_api --no-html --no-webpack --binary-id && cd books_api
Explained:

You will notice books_api as a new directory after running the command, this is the application directory and name. Check the documentation about Phoenix app directory structure for more information.
The parameters --no-html --no-webpack will instruct Phoenix to not generate HTML files and static assets boilerplate. We do this since we are only interested in a rest API.
The parameter --binary-id will configure Ecto to use binary ids (UUIDs) in database schemas.
Generally, mix commands follow the structure of mix task.subtask ARGS, if you just run mix task it will show the available subtasks and mix task.subtask will show the subtask parameters. Try it, you will be amazed by how well Elixir is documented and how intuitive it is.

Setting up the database
Before getting serious with our app, let’s setup it to connect to our database for development and testing purposes. To do that we need to edit config/dev.exs and config/test.exs in our application directory. The default settings look like:

# Configure your database
config :books_api, BooksApi.Repo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "books_api_dev",
  hostname: "localhost",
  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,
  pool_size: 10
You can now create the database for the dev environment with:

$ mix ecto.create
It can also be removed with:

$ mix ecto.drop
Hint: Set the environment variable MIX_ENV before the commands to switch the Phonenix environment, i.e. MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create will create the database for the test environment.

Modelling our data
Before starting, may be valuable to dig into Phoenix Contexts which are in short a way to isolate our system into manageable, independent parts, think of it as an app in Django for example with better organization because it only encapsulates the data and business logic and not the web parts. In this case, we will design our app with a Store context that will have Books for now but could have Authors as a separate schema in the future with a relationship to the books.

Now we have everything we need to start creating our Books database model (Schema in Elixir’s Ecto terminology). To do so, run the following generator in the application directory:

$ mix phx.gen.context Store Book books \
title:string isbn:text:unique description:text price:float authors:array:string
Explained:

Store is the context’s module name.
Book is the schema’s module name.
books is the Database table’s name.
The rest is field definitions. You can learn more about them on https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html.
This command will generate:

The Schema definition at lib/books_api/store/book.ex that maps the data stored in the database to Elixir data structures and adds validation:
defmodule BooksApi.Store.Book do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  @primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}
  @foreign_key_type :binary_id
  schema "books" do
    field :authors, {:array, :string}
    field :description, :string
    field :isbn, :string
    field :price, :float
    field :title, :string

    timestamps()
  end

  @doc false
  def changeset(book, attrs) do
    book
    |> cast(attrs, [:title, :isbn, :description, :price, :authors])
    |> validate_required([:title, :isbn, :description, :price, :authors])
    |> unique_constraint(:isbn)
  end
end
Context module at lib/books_api/store.ex with default CRUD queries for Books. These queries can be adjusted to your own needs to filter stuff or add more queries.
Migration file at **priv/repo/migrations/_create_books.exs**. Migrations are were we introduce DB level constraints and indexes as needed. Unlike Django migrations, we cannot generate them automatically from schema changes so these need to be created manually as you edit your DB schema.
Tests for the generated schema and queries.
Running Migrations
Once we are happy with our data schema and migration we can run the migrations with:

$ mix ecto.migrate
Generating the REST endpoints
Now that we have our DB schemas ready, let’s create the books JSON resource. To do so we will run a generator similar to the previous one to generate the Context and Schema:

$ mix phx.gen.json Store Book books \
title:string isbn:text:unique description:text price:float authors:array:string --no-context --no-schema
Explained:

The parameters --no-context --no-schema will ensure no context and schema are generated since we already have them from the previous step.
This command generates:

A CRUD controller for the books at lib/books_api_web/controllers/book_controller.ex.
View for rendering books JSON at lib/books_api_web/views/book_view.ex.
Controller and View used as a fallback for rendering errors when a controller operation fails.
Tests for the endpoints.
We need to edit the fallback controller and add a call/2 function to handle invalid supplied data and return a 422 error:

# This clause will handle invalid resource data.
def call(conn, {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}}) do
    conn
    |> put_status(:unprocessable_entity)
    |> put_view(BooksApiWeb.ErrorView)
    |> render(:"422")
end
Adding the routes
At this point, we have data, queries to manipulate/query the data and controllers, views to manage that data over REST. Maybe everything works? let’s run $ mix test and figure out.

Oops, we can see some failures similar to:

  1) test delete book deletes chosen book (BooksApiWeb.BookControllerTest)
     test/books_api_web/controllers/book_controller_test.exs:90
     ** (UndefinedFunctionError) function BooksApiWeb.Router.Helpers.book_path/3 is undefined or private
     code: conn = delete(conn, Routes.book_path(conn, :delete, book))
     stacktrace:
       ...
It’s complaining about missing a book_path/3 function. To fix this, we need to add a route to map a URL to the controller. Add the books resource to your :api scope in lib/books_api_web/router.ex:

resources "/books", BookController, except: [:new, :edit]
Running tests again should be all green:

$ mix test

Running the App
Now let’s try running the app. For running the development server, run the following command on your terminal:

$ mix phx.server
Or run it while having an Elixir REPL (IEx) available with:

$ iex -S mix phx.server
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.0.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe] [dtrace]

Generated books_api app
[info] Running BooksApiWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.8.0 at 0.0.0.0:4000 (http)
[info] Access BooksApiWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000
Interactive Elixir (1.10.3) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
Now visit http://localhost:4000 in your web browser and the following page should appear:

Phoenix

Note the URLs for the Books resource are listed there.

Interacting with the API
So now use the book URLs and paste it in Postman to start interacting with the books resource.

Postman POST

Extra tips
Try visiting http://localhost:4000/dashboard and a nice system dashboard will show up:

LiveDashboard

This is called Phoenix LiveDashboard and allows you to easily monitor your system and register custom application metrics, but that’s a subject for another post.

To avoind seeing the Phoenix HTML page that lists the routes (Really a 404), you could set debug_errors to false in config/dev.exs, then restart your server:

config :books_api, BooksApiWeb.Endpoint,
  # ...
  debug_errors: false,
  # ...
Now, visiting http://localhost:4000 yields:

{ 
    "errors": {
        "detail": "Not Found"
    }
}
