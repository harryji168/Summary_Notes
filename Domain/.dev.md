.dev is a top-level domain name operated by Google.[1] It was proposed in ICANN's new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program, and became available to the general public on March 1, 2019, with an early access period that began on February 19.[2] To increase the security of the domains, the entire gTLD has been included in the HSTS preload-list; as a result, popular web browsers will only connect to a .dev webpage using HTTPS.[3]
