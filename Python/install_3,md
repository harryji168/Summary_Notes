Step 1 — Setting Up Python 3
Ubuntu 20.04 and other versions of Debian Linux ship with Python 3 pre-installed. To make sure that our versions are up-to-date, let’s update and upgrade the system with the apt command to work with Ubuntu’s Advanced Packaging Tool:

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
 
The -y flag will confirm that we are agreeing for all items to be installed, but depending on your version of Linux, you may need to confirm additional prompts as your system updates and upgrades.

Once the process is complete, we can check the version of Python 3 that is installed in the system by typing:

python3 -V
 
You’ll receive output in the terminal window that will let you know the version number. While this number may vary, the output will be similar to this:

Output
Python 3.8.10
