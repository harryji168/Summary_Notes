Project mention: CircleCI Vs. GitLab: Choosing The Right CI/CD Tool | dev.to | 2021-03-15
Do you know G2 awards 4.4 stars to both GitLab & CircleCI? Just like GitHub stars, StackShares stack counts reflect the popularity of technology. CircleCI boasts around 7.4k stacks, while GitLab enjoys 31.1k stacks. Besides, GitLab as well as GitLab CI are open-source technologies and have garnered 22k+ stars on GitHub. Wait, this is not a reflection of how good GitLab is at CI/CD. These numbers reflect overall popularity. CircleCI is primarily ‚Äúa niche-focused continuous integration tool‚Äù while GitLab wears multiple hats, including ‚Äúversion control & code collaborator.‚Äù

Project mention: Stop Building a General Purpose API to Power Your Own Front End | news.ycombinator.com | 2021-09-13
I can't speak much about Rails, as I've only played with it. But I've used a lot Django in the past.

Regarding the Django admin (in rails you have ActiveAdmin[1]) think if it just as a glorified database explorer. It is an internal tool for developers, product managers and maybe for your support team. It is in no way thought to be used by end users. Every attempt I've seen to use it as such was a catastrophic failure.

With Django, if you know plain HTML and CSS, with the tools I've mentioned in the comment you're responding to, you can build almost anything... For example, let's say you need a highly interactive client side table.... you can always just attach a Vue or a React component for it by using Unpoly compilers [2].

I'd say this stack is less useful the more your app needs to work fully offline... but if you don't have that constraint... I cannot think of anything that can't be built faster and safer.

Project mention: Recommend a fixtures replacement (e.g ruby factory-bot) in Golang. | reddit.com/r/golang | 2021-08-15
When I switch language from ruby to golang, I desired to have an alternative to factory-bot (a ruby gem). Therefore, I found the go-factory which can be used to build random object for testing. After using it for a while, I decide to build another fixtures replacement package which is gogo-factory.

A static analysis security vulnerability scanner for Ruby on Rails applications

Project mention: OWASP Top 10 for Developers: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities | dev.to | 2021-09-14
In order to prevent this issue, your organization needs to implement regular checks of your dependencies against the CVE database for known vulnerabilities, as well as establishing a process for keeping all dependencies up-to-date. Fortunately, much of this can be automated using vulnerability scanning tools, such as the OWASP Dependency Check, RetireJS, or Brakeman. Additional tools, such as WhiteSource's Renovate, provide a complete dependency management solution by automatically updating any found vulnerabilities. In addition to keeping dependencies updated, it's important to remove any dependencies that are no longer being used.
