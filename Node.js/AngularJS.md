# AngularJS

AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework for developing single-page applications. It is maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.

AngularJS is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.

The AngularJS framework is on Long Term Support ("LTS") until December 31, 2021.[3][4] After that date Google will no longer update AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery issues.[5][4] The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but they also provided some other options.[6]
