nvm version

nvm list available


nvm install 16


nvm list available provided a convenient partial list of Node versions available to be installed
nvm install installed the required Node version (a 64-bit version by default since the current systemâ€™s architecture is 64-bit)
nvm use activated the version that was just installed
nvm list confirmed that the correct version of Node was installed and activated (other installed versions would be listed if they existed)
