JS: Objects

# [000] The Object Type

Objects are records of data organized as a collection of key value pairs. They're really good at modeling real world objects:

```js
const car = {
  name: "lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
};
```

- We declare an object using curly braces `{}`
- Every key should be a string (quotes omitted) and followed by a value seperated by a colon `:`
- Each key value pair is seperated by a comma
- in other languages they're also called dictionaries or hashes.
- key names within an object must be unique
- key's are also called properties

# [100] Selecting properties

Like arrays and strings we can select specific things within an object. But instead of selecting by index we select by keys

## Square Bracket Notation
We can use **square bracket notation** to select properties of an object.

```js
const car = {
  name: "lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
};

car["name"]; // lisa
car["brand"]; // Tesla
```

## Dot Notation
We can also use **dot notation** to select properties as well

```js
const car = {
  name: "lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
};

car.name; // lisa
car.brand; // Tesla
```

## Selecting a non-existent key
If we try to select the key of an object which does not exist we will get back `undefined`
```js
const car = {
  name: "lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
};
car.owner; // undefined
car["owner"] // undefined
```


## Square Bracket Notation Cont.

Use square bracket notation when keys consist of special characters or spaces

```js
const specialCar = {
  "full name": "Lisa Tank",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}

dog["full name"]; // "Lisa Tank";
dog."full name"; // Does not work! Error
```

Square bracket notation is also useful to select using keys built from expressions (dynamic)

```js
const specialCar = {
  "full name": "Lisa Tank",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}

dog["full" + " name"]; // "Lisa Tank";
const a = "make";
const b = "Year";
dog[`${a}${b}`]; // 2020;
```

The expression within the square brackets will evaluate into a value before being used as a string to select the key.

## Adding and changing key values

We can add or change a property's value by selecting the property and using an assignment operator `=`

```js
const car = {
  name: "Lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}

car.lastName = "Tank"; // we've added a key called "lastName" with the value of "Tank" to the `car` object
car.makeYear = 1990; // we've overwritten the existing makeYear
car["brand"] = "Ford"; // we've overwritten the existing brand
const a = "model"
car[a] = "Focus"; // we've overwritten the existing model
```

### Demo: Word Counts

Write a function, wordCounts, that takes a string and returns an object containing the count of each word ignoring case.

```js
function wordCounts(string) {
  const strings = string.split(" "); // getting an array of all the words
  const wordMap = {}; // intializing an empty object
  strings.forEach((string) => {
    if (wordMap[string]) { // look for this key in our wordMap object
      // if that word is not undefined (meaning it's at least 1) then increment.
      wordMap[string] += 1;
    } else {
      // if that word is undefined then give it the value of 1.
      wordMap[string] = 1;
    }
  })
  return wordMap;
}

console.log(wordCounts("this is this and that is that"));
```

### Exercise: Character counts

Write a function, countChars, that takes a string and returns an object containing the count of each character ignoring letter casing.

## Object Documentation

**MDN Docs for Objects can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)**

### Exercise: Finding useful object functions

## A function to get all keys
```js
const car = {
  name: "Lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}
Object.keys(car);
```

## A function to get all values
```js
const car = {
  name: "Lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}
Object.values(car);
```

## A function to merge all key value pairs in an object
```js
const car = {
  name: "Lisa",
  brand: "Tesla",
  makeYear: 2020,
  model: "roadster",
}
const parts = {
  doors: 4,
  airConditioning: true,
  passengers: ['Jenny', 'Jeese', 'Ros√©', 'lisa'],
}

const mergedObject = Object.assign(car, parts);
```

# [200] Iterating Over Objects

The `for in loop` is a statement that makes it really easy to iterate over an object's keys.

It looks very similar to the `for of loop` but be aware they are very different. **`for in loop` should ONLY be used for objects**.

```js
const fridgeItems = { eggs: 4, milks: 2, carrots: 55, leftOvers: 9999 };

for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(`key: ${key}`, `value: ${obj[key]}`);
}
```

The `for in loop` is made of several parts:
1) the keyword `for`
2) parenthesis that hold two parameters
  a) a variable declaration `let key`
  b) followed by keyword `in` and the object we're iteration over `obj`
3) a code block `{console.log(`key: ${key}`, `value: ${obj[key]}`);}`

## Exercise: Object to Array
Create a function, toArray, that takes a object and returns a 2d array of key-value pairs.

```js
function toArray(obj) {
  let arrayBuffer = [];
  for (let key in obj) {
    arrayBuffer.push([key, obj[key]]);
  }
  return arrayBuffer;
}
```

# [300] Methods

A method is a property of a object whose value is a function.

See the following:
_dog object_
```js
const dog = {
  name: 'Ralph',
  age: 10,
  bark: function() {
    return 'Bork';
  }
}

dog.bark();
```

On declaration of this object we've defined a "bark" method. We can execute this method by selecting the property and appending parenthesis `()` like we would any other function.

We can also assign a function to an object's property to create a method

```js
function bark() {
  return 'Bork';
}

const dog = {
  name: 'Ralph',
  age: 10,
  bark: bark
}

dog.oops = function() {
  return 'ruh roh';
}

dog.bark();
dog.oops();
```

## Demo: ArrayUtils

Create an ArrayUtils object with methods to manipulate arrays.

```js
const ArrayUtils =  {
  last: function(arr) {
    return arr[arr.length - 1];
  },
  first: function(arr) {
    return arr[0];
  },
  take: function(arr, n) {
    return arr.slice(0, n);
  }
};
```

### Exercise: toObject

Add the method toObject to ArrayExtras that converts a 2d array into an object.
```js
ArrayUtils = {};
const arr = [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]];

ArrayUtils.toObject = function(matrix) {
  const hashBuffer = {};
  for (let arr of matrix) {
    hashBuffer[arr[0]] = arr[1];
  }
  return hashBuffer;
}
ArrayUtils.toObject(arr);
```

# [400] Why use methods over plain functions?

We can use objects to organize a bunch of functions that are related to each other like our `ArrayUtils` object. 

But, there's something else in Javascript that makes methods so powerful...

## keyword `this`

`this` is a special keyword that is used inside of methods.

`this` is a variable that points to the object that owns the method!

We use it to share the object's properties between methods of that object.

## Demo: Counter

To demonstrate the usefulness of `this` let's create a counter object.

```js
const counter = {
  currentCount: 0,
  set: function(n) {
    this.currentCount = n;
  },
  inc: function() {
    this.currentCount++;
  },
  dec: function() {
    this.currentCount--;
  },
  now: function() {
    console.log(this.currentCount);
  }
}
```

## Demo: Counter cont.
Now, we have a functioning counter object. Let's try it out:

```js
counter.now(); // prints 0;
counter.inc(); // increases the currentCount property by 1;
counter.now(); // prints 1;
counter.dec(); // decreases the currentCount property by 1;
counter.now(); // prints 0;
counter.set(5000); // sets the currentCount property to 5000;
counter.now(); // prints 5000;
```

## Exercise: Configurable Steps

Add the ability to configure how many steps the counter increments and decrements. By default the step should be set to 1.

```js
```

## Exercise: Chainable Counter

Add the ability to call `.inc()` or `.dec()` one after the other in a chain...
```js
```
