# How to change the scroll direction on a Mac?

Is your Mac’s mouse wheel scrolling the wrong way? It’s no problem — you can easily change this from System Preferences.

Change scroll direction on your Mac

Open System Preferences from the Apple menu.

If you’re using your laptop’s trackpad, select Trackpad. If you’re using an external mouse, select Mouse.

Open the second tab, Scroll & Zoom.

Change scrolling speed on Mac
If you find yourself scrolling past important passages too quickly or inching down a page with long, sweeping scrolls, you might need to change your scrolling speed. This process is slightly different for a trackpad and a mouse.

To change your mouse’s scrolling speed:

Go to System Preferences > Mouse.

Use the slider to adjust your scrolling speed. You can do this a little at a time — as the speed changes immediately, you can test out different speeds on a document or web page.

To change your trackpad’s scrolling speed:

Go to System Preferences > Accessibility.

Select Pointer Control from the menu on the left.

Choose Mouse & Trackpad tab. 

Select Trackpad Options.

To adjust the scrolling speed of your mouse, go to the Mouse Options.
