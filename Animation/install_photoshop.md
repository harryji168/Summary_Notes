# Install and use Adobe Photoshop on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

1 instll wine

5. Also install PlayOnLinux
The problem with Wine is without any graphical user interface it becomes complicated for new users to easily install the dependencies required by the Windows application such as Photoshop on Linux. Hence to solve this problem we can use PlayOnLinux, a GUI front-end for Wine. It makes the installation of Win apps easier than the command line. And the good thing its packages are available on the official repository of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, thus with one command, we can install it on our system.


sudo apt install playonlinux
