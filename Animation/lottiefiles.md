7. Lottie
If youâ€™re interested in mobile development, then you should check out this awesome Java project on Github. Lottie is a mobile library which analyses animations from Adobe After Effects with higher accuracy and allows you to use them in your mobile applications. It exports the animations JSON and processes them on the mobile natively. You can use it to add beautiful animations to your design and make it more interactive. 

You can use Lottie with iOS, Windows, and React Native as well. Getting familiar with this project would help you understand how you can use Java in the front-end better and enhance the appearances of your different products.
