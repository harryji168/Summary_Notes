The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n (where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word internationalization, a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s)[4][5] and L10n for localization, due to the length of the words.[1][6] Some writers have the latter acronym capitalized to help distinguish the two.[7]
