The terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n (where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first i and the last n in the word internationalization, a usage coined at Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1970s or 1980s)[4][5] and L10n for localization, due to the length of the words.[1][6] Some writers have the latter acronym capitalized to help distinguish the two.[7]

  Start up the project
I am going to bootstrap together a simple React application using create-react-app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```cd my-app

Next, let’s cd into the React app directory and install a few i18next packages:

npm install i18next react-i18next i18next-http-backend i18next-browser-languagedetector --save

Don’t worry, these packages are all very lightweight and easy to use. Here’s what they do:

 

i18next: The base i18next library.

react-i18next: Gives us React-friendly hooks, components, and functions for i18next.

i18next-http-backend: Let’s us use AJAX for loading translation files.

i18next-browser-languagedetector: Detects your users’ preferred language based on browser settings.

 

Let’s start up our development server with npm start

Here we go!
