# Project Jupyter 
(/ˈdʒuːpɪtər/ (About this soundlisten)) is a project and community whose goal is to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages".[2] It was spun off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando Pérez[3] and Brian Granger.[4] Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Project Jupyter has developed and supported the interactive computing products Jupyter Notebook, JupyterHub, and JupyterLab. Jupyter is a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project
