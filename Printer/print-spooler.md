Fix for “The print spooler service is not running” Error in Windows

Press “Window key” + “R” to open the Run dialog
Type “services.msc“, then select “OK“.
Double-click the “Printer Spooler” service, and then change the startup type to “Automatic“. This sets the Spooler service to start automatically when you restart the computer. Select “OK“.
Restart the computer and try to install the printer again.
If the Print Spooler service keeps stopping after your restart it, the problem is most likely related to corrupted printer drivers that are installed on the computer. Try uninstalling all printers and printer software from the computer and start from scratch. This may include PDF writer or faxing software as well. Anything listed in the Control Panel under Printers & Faxes I would do away with. If there is any software installed for other printers in Add/Remove Programs I would uninstall it all. Obtain updated software from your printer manufacturers and reinstall only the items you need.
