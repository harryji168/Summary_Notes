It is not a big deal, right now the code is the best of all the three versions. Just a little big, I should not lose all marks for this part.

I also did a lot of extra work, and basic on make an app auto_unsplash https://github.com/harryji168/auto_unsplash and full screenshot readme https://github.com/harryji168/Summary_Notes/blob/99ad209d1f72c95fc94556ccea11b31f9d00c685/Node/Node_project.md
 

The marker didn't pay attention to the whole picture of my work, work history, and extra work. 
I already uploaded the demo data for testing. She didn't review it or use it.
