  ### A successfully submitted cluck redirects the user to the index page.	❌	Redirected to the show page  
  
  
  ##### not agree
  
  
  I redirect a full control page, include back to index list, also include " Edit" and "Delete" feature.   this not required by quiz instruction, but it should hidden features that need include in the quiz, because the database->clucks table,  have updated_at fields, if don't have this feature, then this field will be no use.
