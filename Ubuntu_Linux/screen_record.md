Ubuntu,
Linux Mint,
...

If you are using Ubuntu 17.04 or newer, SimpleScreenRecorder can be found in the official repositories. You can install it with:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder
Add this if you want to record 32-bit OpenGL applications on a 64-bit system:

sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder-lib:i386
You should copy-paste these commands to a terminal line by line rather than all at once, otherwise it won't work.

If you are using an older version of Ubuntu, or you want to get the latest version of SimpleScreenRecorder immediately without waiting for the next Ubuntu release, you can also get the package(s) from the SimpleScreenRecorder PPA:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder
Add this if you want to record 32-bit OpenGL applications on a 64-bit system:

sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder-lib:i386

# Screenshots and screencasts
You can take a picture of your screen (a screenshot) or record a video of what is happening on the screen (a screencast). This is useful if you want to show someone how to do something on the computer, for example. Screenshots and screencasts are just normal picture and video files, so you can email them and share them on the web.

Take a screenshot
Open Screenshot from the Activities overview.

In the Screenshot window, select whether to grab the whole screen, the current window, or an area of the screen. Set a delay if you need to select a window or otherwise set up your desktop for the screenshot.

Click Take Screenshot.

If you selected Selection, the pointer changes into a crosshair. Click and drag the area you want for the screenshot.

In the Save Screenshot window, enter a file name and choose a folder, then click Save.

Alternatively, import the screenshot directly into an image-editing application without saving it first. Click Copy to Clipboard then paste the image in the other application, or drag the screenshot thumbnail to the application.

Keyboard shortcuts
Quickly take a screenshot of the desktop, a window, or an area at any time using these global keyboard shortcuts:

Print Screen to take a screenshot of the desktop.

Alt+Print Screen to take a screenshot of a window.

Shift+Print Screen to take a screenshot of an area you select.

When you use a keyboard shortcut, the image is automatically saved in your Pictures folder in your home folder with a file name that begins with Screenshot and includes the date and time it was taken.

If you do not have a Pictures folder, the images will be saved in your home folder instead.

You can also hold down Ctrl with any of the above shortcuts to copy the screenshot image to the clipboard instead of saving it.

Make a screencast
You can make a video recording of what is happening on your screen:

Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R to start recording what is on your screen.

A red circle is displayed in the top right corner of the screen when the recording is in progress.

Once you have finished, press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R again to stop the recording.

The video is automatically saved in your Videos folder in your home folder, with a file name that starts with Screencast and includes the date and time it was taken.

If you do not have a Videos folder, the videos will be saved in your home folder instead.
