Enable Always on Top Manually
The default and probably the most preferred way of enabling the Always on Top mode is manually using a mouse and keyboard. It involves the following two steps:


Open the app you want to pin on top of the screen.
Right-click on the appâ€™s title bar and select Always on Top from the menu options. Alternatively, right-click on the title bar and press the T key.
Once enabled, your pinned window will now afloat other app windows on your desktop. To disable it, go over the same steps again.
