Hi , thanks for asking this question here is what you can do

Click on "Application" then Accessories" and finally "Terminal"
Enter this command line "sudo visudo" and press enter.
Enter your password then press Enter.
Search for "%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL"
And replace the line by "%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.
